## Project Background  
To support budgeting and reduce power supply costs, I developed recurring analyses that forecasted demand reduction potential across distributed energy resources (DERs) and coincidental peak (CP) rate participation. These insights guided monthly system planning and informed financial strategy.

## Tools Used  
- **Excel** – Forecast modeling and analysis  
- **Power BI** – Dashboard development and stakeholder reporting  
- **SQL** – Data querying and preparation  
- **MDM Portals** – Utility and wholesale provider demand and interval data  
- **NOAA API** – Integrated weather data for forecasting context  
- **PowerPoint** – Reporting and presentation to leadership and finance teams

## Skills Demonstrated  
- Peak demand forecasting and CP rate analysis  
- DER performance evaluation (batteries, generators, thermostat programs, PPAs)  
- Capacity cost avoidance modeling  
- BI dashboard development and data storytelling  
- Partial automation of manual data collection processes  
- Cross-functional collaboration across finance, engineering, billing, and key accounts  
- Utility operations, planning, and regulatory support

## Summary  
Each month, I analyzed DER performance—including utility-scale batteries, generator assets, thermostat programs, production from solar and methane PPAs, and coincidental peak rate participation—to forecast avoidable power supply costs and potential demand reduction during peak events. Where possible, I streamlined portions of the manual data collection process to improve efficiency and reduce recurring effort.

The analysis directly informed stakeholders and critical functions across the organization: aligning capacity savings with budget expectations for finance, setting SCADA parameters to optimize load control deployment and capture monthly peaks, supplying billable timestamps to the external billing vendor to ensure accurate CP charges, and advising key account managers when major accounts did not participate—enabling proactive outreach to impacted members.

## Key Takeaways  
- Forecasted demand reduction and avoided capacity costs using DER performance data and CP rate participation  
- Enabled strategic deployment of load control through coordination with engineering and SCADA operations  
- Improved budgeting accuracy and stakeholder alignment across finance, billing, and account management teams

> “This analysis gave cross-functional teams the visibility they needed to manage costs, optimize timing, and better serve members during peak events.”
